Nightcrawler says he will need them, but Kurt is afraid not. He has to keep him company. Nightcrawler teleports back to the mansion to inform Nightcrawler that the X-Men have arrived. Nightcrawler looks out the window and sees Wolverine and Nightcrawler. They are really not around to see it. Then, suddenly, a telepathic image of Nightcrawler enters the room. Nightcrawler is surprised by the telepathic appearance. He is surprised that her telepathy is as strong as he’s seeing. He knows she is in pain, but he is confident she is not as brainwashed as he thought. He then teleports out to find them. He is amazed at the way Wolverine’s emotions appear to him. He is furious. He realizes they are in trouble. Kurt teleports Kurt and Logan to the professor. When he is finished, Kurt tells him that Nightcrawler is a friend of his and they can work on their problems together. The professor is shocked, and Kurt asks what he is doing. He is doing something. Kurt asks if he is going to the Professor, and Kurt turns the professor’s computer on. In the mansion, Wolverine is amazed by what is happening. He sees the Professor and Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler tells him that every X-Man has a future for certain. He has held Jean’s hand since they met. They are not the same people. Wolverine tells him that one day he will think for himself. He can’t imagine what will happen. Nightcrawler tells him that he has to show him. He has to think. Wolverine tells him to think. He is not the same person. Logan tells him that he has to think for himself and try to find something. He knows that the Professor and his team are getting along fine, but he cannot find any reason to. Logan begins to ask how can they be together? They are not. They are nearly dead. He realizes that they are both in need of guidance. Nightcrawler tells him that he is a good person who cares for others, but he has to help him. Logan is not the only one. Kurt looks at his watch and wonders what is happening. Kurt turns to the Professor and tells him that he is the first to leave. Kurt asks him to come back on his own. Nightcrawler and Wolverine are in a room with Professor and Professor’s old friend, Professor Xavier. Kurt doesn’t understand what is happening to Kurt, but he does understand that he is in need of someone new. Kurt takes on the Professor’s codename of Mr. Sinister and asks him to tell him why he is in need of him. The Professor tells Kurt that there are reasons for concern. The professor said he did not think he would ever have to work with such a man. Kurt tells the Professor that he is in need of someone who cares for him. Kurt is shocked. The Professor tells Kurt that Sinister’s codename is Professor Xavier. Kurt puts his hand on the Professor’s shoulder and tells the professor that he wants him to know that he is not alone. The Professor says that it is good to hear. Kurt is shocked and tells the professor that he is sorry. The Professor reminds Kurt that the Professor was once his mentor. He did not want him to be apart from the others. Kurt tells the Professor that he is going to start taking responsibility for his own destiny. The Professor says that he is going to leave. Kurt tells the Professor that Xavier taught him how to save people, but not how to save himself. Kurt asks the Professor how he could have known that, but the Professor tells him that he will always be a threat to him. The Professor tells Kurt that he has lost a lot in his life. Kurt looks at the Professor’s watch and asks if he is going to die. The Professor is not phased by the question and turns to leave.
