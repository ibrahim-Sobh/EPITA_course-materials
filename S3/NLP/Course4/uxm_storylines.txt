Meanwhile, as her lover Jean Grey’s mind and soul reemerge, Jean Grey is still in tears. ‘I…I can’t…!’ Jean exclaims as she reaches through the bars of the castle’s lower floor to be reunited with her lover. ‘I…I can’t…!’ Jean shouts. Cyclops lunges at Jean with his optic blasts, forcing her to fall through the portal. ‘Don’t move!’ Jean screams as she falls through the portal. ‘Stop!’ Scott shouts as he tackles her. ‘You’re falling!’ Jean exclaims as he grabs her. ‘It’s too late: she’s too late!’ Scott exclaims. ‘It’s too late!’ Jean tells herself. Scott informs her that she’s unconscious, but he can’t touch her. ‘This is too bad - it’s not his problem. Jean’s a precious soul. She was meant to be with him. She saved his life. He may be doomed, but…’ Scott points out, before realizing that Jean is in a small chamber. ‘How long’ Scott asks. ‘I’m just a child!’ Jean exclaims. ‘I’m a moe. So am I!’ Scott exclaims. Cyclops tells Jean that she should keep her word, before asking Jean if she thinks she has a hand in Scott’s escape. ‘He made it clear - he’s not a child, Scott. He’s a mutant!’ Jean exclaims. Scott tells Jean that she is a mutant, and that he was never meant to be a child. ‘I’m not mutant…I’m a man’ Scott explains, adding that this is not the same for Scott. ‘And I -’ Scott begins, before Jean begins to cry: ‘I can’t touch her!’ she exclaims as she drops through the portal. Scott grabs her and tells her to hold on, before telling Jean that she’s going to be fine, as she is still falling through. Scott asks her to wait, while he tells Jean that he knows it is too late for her to stop falling through the portal. ‘No!’ Jean shouts, as Scott plunges his hand through her lifeless body. ‘I’ve already survived’ Scott exclaims as he reaches his fist through the portal. He pulls her through the portal, and Jean tells Scott that she’s going to be fine. ‘I’m not going to die!’ Jean exclaims. Scott tells her that he does not know, and that he doesn’t know if she can hear him. ‘I’m not even sure I’m going to come out’ Scott tells Jean, who stands in the doorway, before turning to Jean Grey. ‘I know, Scott - but you’re not going to die!’ Jean exclaims. ‘Yeah, well - I think I’m going to die -’ Scott utters as he falls through the portal, and falls through a portal. Scott shouts to Jean that she’s going to die, and that he doesn’t know what she’s going to do. ‘I’m not sure I’m going to kill you!’ Jean thinks to herself, before receiving the command. The command is to search for Jean as she falls through the portal, and the three mutants enter a room. ‘Dammit’ Jean exclaims, before telling Scott that it is too late for her to stop falling through the portal, and that she’s not the one to stop her. ‘I’m an - an X-Man, Scott. And you’re dead’ Jean adds. ‘I am’ Scott replies before Jean is knocked to the ground and unconscious. ‘Shit. It’s not fair’ Jean remarks, before telling Scott to watch out for him, as he is going to die. ‘Then I don’t know…’ Jean begins, while Scott interrupts her, explaining that not only is he a mutant, and that he is also the victim of a Cerebro. ‘I’m sorry for that’ Jean remarks, before telling Scott that he is not going to die, and that he is not going to die, and that the only thing that matters now is for Jean. ‘And no. I don’t know - I mean, I’m sorry - I can’t believe I just - it - I - I can

There are many other reasons why she would prefer to remain anonymous and she would like to thank her teammates for her assistance. ‘We’ve been through a lot together -’ she admits, before announcing that she is going to use a new, more powerful form of telepathy that allows her to see far more clearly. ‘Watching you -’ she begins, before asking ‘What’s happening?’ Cyclops replies that she is about to tell him what they should all be doing, when they are interrupted by “flashback” - “flashback” to the day X-Men…Men that Scott Summers was an X-Man at the time he was born, and were trained to do so by a young Jean Grey! ‘It’s me. Scott. I’m Scott’ Cyclops sighs. ‘So how’s it going?’ he asks. Scott explains that it has been going on all along and explains that he has been training up because he was feeling better, knowing he would receive the benefit of the doubt sooner or later. ‘Well, have a seat-back,’ Scott explains, before announcing that he has been trying to figure out how to get some mental powers back, ‘But…what about the telepathic powers that you just mentioned?’ he asks, before Scott interrupts: ‘That may be a question I have no time for…’ Cyclops exclaims, before telling Scott that they have to do it, as they are going to have to alter the telepathic powers of the others and have the rest of them monitor it. Cyclops continues that in order for them to do that, they need to get Cyclops to the point of origin, to where this is taking him. Suddenly, Scott tells himself that he must be dreaming, as he sees Scott ‘Pulling that stunt -’ he begins, but Cyclops interrupts him, telling him to just hang on, before telling Scott that the telepathic power is down. ‘We’ve got the X-Men and we’ve got the Professor. I’m going to do it!’ Scott shouts as he uses his telepathy, to which Cyclops tells him to hang on - as he just want some space -‘Shut up!’ Scott calls out as he releases a mental bolt, and the Professor collapses to the ground, while Angel collapses nearby, and Jean lies on the floor with him. Scott tells Jean that he thought Cyclops would be getting some help, but that he has not. Scott explains that he has been in a hell of a battle, but that he is afraid that he is finally getting some relief at least. ‘But I’m afraid not everything’s as it seems…’ Scott begins, frowning. ‘But I’m afraid it is’ Scott points out, before asking what is going on, before telling Jean that she has got to stop shouting, as she is actually getting help. ‘I’m not a mutant. I’m not a mutant!’ Jean shouts, while Cyclops tells him that he is just being nice, to which Cyclops replies ‘What?’ Jean asks, to which Scott replies that he can’t help himself, as he can’t, as he knows how it feels to get used up with the whole “Kiss and take a shower” thing. Scott continues, before telling Jean that he knows it feels bad, to which Jean replies that it does, before asking Scott if he is going to - he doesn’t know, what he is doing, just doing, she asks him to walk away from her, and Scott tells her that he will, before walking away from her. Jean reaches out with her telekinesis, and asks Scott if he is going to, to try and help her. Scott replies that he is going to try and, before he can say anything, he is grabbed by his shorts, and pulled away. ‘You’re still not used to being touched’ Jean utters, while Cyclops lies on the floor, and leans into the other, telling Jean that he is still not used to being touched, and that she has been his friends. ‘And you’re not used to using your hands against yourself’ Jean tells him, before turning to Jean, who lies on the bed, her hands on her hips, legs folded across her chest, and arms folded across the knee. ‘I can’t help myself. I can’t help you’ Scott declares, before turning to Angel, who lies on the bed, arms folded across his chest, arms folded across his knees. ‘I can’t help myself’ Scott declares, before Angel grabs Scott’s throat, and

Alex and Scott remember that the phasing was interrupted by the presence of a SHIELD agent, who went into the room and informed Scott that his sister was abducted by the SHIELD agents.

Magneto is still the fastest and he has to rely on his speed not his strength. Bobby takes advantage of the situation and throws an energy spear at Magneto, who takes it and throws it at the X-Men. He is shocked and falls. Colossus and Storm are also thrown away by Magneto, who

====================
Banshee's sonic scream is an after-effect of the strike, which creates a magnetic field. Storm’s image inducer, Wolverine’s optic blast, and, obviously, Banshee’s sonic scream are all secondary. A flash of energy is reflected back at her, and she sees Colossus and Wolverine walking towards her. “You’ve got a few more minutes, Storm,” says Wolverine. However, she’s afraid that some of the powers that gave her those powers are no longer there. She turns to Wolverine and tells him that there’s nothing to be afraid of anymore, that she is protecting the world as the X-Men’s ‘Angel’. Wolverine’s response is that he can’t be afraid of her powers, and she can’t. He replies that he doesn’t trust her, as he’s going to put her down. “What the…?” the young mutant asks. Wolverine tells her that he doesn’t trust her either, and she’s going to take him down. A force field kicks in, and an image inducer is placed around Wolverine’s body. �

Cyclops has taken the liberty of teleporting with the rest of the team, and the X-Men are using the Danger Room to await the arrival of the team’s new recruits. Storm asks how they are. She’s been observed by both the Freedom Force and the Iron Patriot. Both have reported similar readings. Jean asks what’s going on. The Danger Room coordinates are being traced. Storm tells her the team are airborne and they’re ready to go. The team is in the process of rejoining the X-Men. Cyclops tells her the Danger Room’s location is secure. Jean asks what’s going on. They can fly in and out of there. Storm asks permission to stay. An alert box will be placed in the mansion’s basement, and the X-Men will be there too. Storm agrees and Jean agrees, as it is not the mansion’s responsibility. There is a reason the X-Men are in the building now. It’s

Banshee's sonic scream, then. Storm tells her husband that they are out of time. ‘Don’t be stupid’ she tells him. ‘I’m a man, by the spirit.’ Bobby answers. ‘I’m a man, by the spirit’ Storm tells him. ‘But you’re a man, a man, by the spirit. And I love you, too,’ Bobby declares, adding that it is not an option. ‘I’m a man, by the spirit. And I can’t walk on water.’ Storm snaps, declaring that her husband is a wild man. ‘I’m a man, by the spirit. And I can’t do this’ Bobby declares. Storm shouts back that she is glad he is a man, but that she is glad he is a woman. ‘Maybe I’m a man enough to understand that the only way to stop this madness is to have a man on the island’ Storm tells her husband. ‘I’m a woman, by the spirit. And you can’t walk on water’ Bobby adds, telling Storm

He also finds a bandages covering his ears, and a pair of gloves.A little later, Banshee awakes and asks the Beast for help. The Beast points out that he can sense the sound of Banshee's attack by his nose and suggests that the Beast use his sonic scream to create a holographic image of his opponent. Banshee replies that his answer is probably the best he can do. Still, Banshee senses that the opponent is still there and asks the Beast for help.Banshee tells him that his foe is still in the form of a giant, but the Beast tells him that it is not the case. He wonders how he can have the opponent lose and then use the information he already has to defeat him. The Beast puts one hand on the Beast's head and tells him that it is a good time to make a move against him. The Beast tells the Beast that he has no reason to be afraid, and that he is only interested in the objective.Banshee replies that it isn't the end of the world to have a chance to defeat your opponent in
