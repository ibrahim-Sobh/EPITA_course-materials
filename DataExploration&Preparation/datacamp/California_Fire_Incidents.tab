Due to increased outflow from Hyatt Power Plant, flows to the Feather River will also increase incrementally throughout the day. This will cause the river to become gradually deeper and swifter so all anglers, boaters, and other river users should be advised of these conditions. Additional flow increases to the Feather River are expected to occur over the next few days.

<p>To News Media: For your safety and the safety of crews working in the construction zone, members of the news media are advised to wear Personal Protection Equipment (PPEs) – hard hat, reflective vest, and sturdy shoes/boots. Those not following this guideline will be asked to leave the area.

<p>The flood control spillway flows remain at 0 cubic feet per second (cfs). Inflows are approximately 10,000 to 15,000 cfs which has resulted in the lake rising from 858.8 feet to 859.7 feet elevation in the last 24 hours. All 5 operational units at the Hyatt Powerplant are currently running, allowing for a total outflow of 8,800 cfs. This situation will be monitored throughout the day to determine the efficiency and safety of excavation during flows.

<p>Contractors continue to remove sediment and debris below the spillway. This operation will continue 24 hours per day. Approximately 715,000 cubic yards of material have been removed from the debris pile to date. Work continues on the area below the emergency spillway.

<p>Flows to meet environmental requirements are being met by releases through the Thermalito Diversion Dam and Thermalito Afterbay River Outlet. The low flow section of the Feather River (the river channel through Oroville) is currently at 3,750 cfs. The total flow to the Feather River at the Thermalito Afterbay River Outlet is currently 5,650 cfs. Flows will gradually increase over the next 24 hours.
