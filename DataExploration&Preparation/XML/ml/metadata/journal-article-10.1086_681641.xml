         <abstract>
            <p>We study the internal organization of French manufacturing firms. We divide the employees of each firm into “layers” using occupational categories. Layers are hierarchical in that the typical worker in a higher layer earns more, and the typical firm occupies less of them. The probability of adding/dropping a layer is positively/negatively correlated with value added. Reorganization, through changes in layers, is essential to understanding how firms grow. Firms that expand substantially add layers and pay lower average wages in all preexisting layers. In contrast, firms that expand little and do not reorganize pay higher average wages in all preexisting layers.</p>

            <p>The frictions in the French labor market, and therefore the implications of firm reorganization on particular individuals, are certainly worth exploring but do not constitute the main focus of our paper. Instead, our aim is to understand if and how firms actively manage and reorganize their labor force. Our focus on firms’ decisions and their performance parallels the work of Bloom and van Reenen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf7">2007</xref>), Bloom, Sadun, and van Reenen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf8">2012</xref>), and Bloom et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf9">2013</xref>), all of which study the effect of management, not organization, on firm characteristics. Our approach also relates to those of Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf2">1994</xref>) and Baker and Holmstrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf3">1995</xref>), who study how a particular firm organizes its internal labor force.</p>

            <p>Direct measures of formal education and experience are not directly available in a way that can be matched to the firm data we are using. So we need to estimate worker-level education and experience using a methodology that we describe in detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sc5">Sec. V</xref>.</p>

            <p>Caroli and van Reenen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf13">2001</xref>) have the advantage of using a measure of delayering directly reported by managers rather than indirectly inferred from the occupational structure, like ours. The advantage of our approach is that it relies less on the subjective views of managers and more on their observed actions. Our measure also allows us to use the universe of manufacturing firms instead of specialized surveys.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that any change that shifts revenue proportionally, like an exogenous firm-level productivity shock, will be isomorphic to a change in α.

            <p>Note that since class 2 includes only owners that receive a wage, some of these firms might have an owner (acting as top manager) who is not being compensated directly with a wage. Even though one might regard one-layer firms as nonstandard, we keep them in the analysis since their behavior is very much in line with the behavior of firms with more layers.</p>

            <p>We define a firm as having “consecutively ordered layers” if it has only layer 1 (occupation 5 or 6), layers 1 and 2 (occupations 4–6), layers 1–3 (occupations 3–6), or all layers (occupations 2–6).</p>

            <p>Here, and in all the subsequent empirical analysis, we study only log changes, although the theory refers to changes in levels. All the theoretical implications can alternatively be expressed in log changes. For our purposes, this distinction is irrelevant since we are almost exclusively interested in sign restrictions. Log changes are scale free, which makes their use convenient in the empirical analysis.</p>

            </label>
            <p>The theory in fact has a more subtle prediction. Namely, the slope of the relationship between the log of value added and normalized hours should decrease as we consider higher layers. The reason is that a larger firm with the same <italic>L</italic> has more knowledgeable workers in all layers, as discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sc2">Sec. II</xref>, and so larger spans of control at all layers.</p>

            </label>
            <p>The theory also predicts that the proportional change in the hours of employees in higher layers should be larger than the proportional change in the hours of employees in lower layers. The reason is that the knowledge of all employees falls and so does the span of each manager. This results in positive but smaller proportional changes in hours at the bottom of the firm, when the firm adds a layer. In table 12 we see, in most cases, exactly the opposite. As in the case of firms that keep the number of layers constant, the lower layers expand proportionally more. Several forces can be responsible for this mismatch between the theory and the data. First, during a year, firms that switch might also have grown without further changes in the number of layers. Since according to the theory the rank of the log changes is different depending on whether layers are added or not, what we see could be the result of one effect dominating the other. Second, there could be frictions in hiring that make lower layers easier to expand than higher ones. This would be the case if hiring more knowledgeable employees is more costly and takes more time. Finally, the theory suggests that changes in communication costs, <italic>h</italic>, as the firm adds layers could also reverse the implications of the theory on this ranking.</p>

            </label>
            <p>We interpret our results as the effect of organizational changes resulting from expansions in value added as a consequence of technology or demand shocks. However, changes in a firm’s organization could also be the result of changes in the cost of acquiring knowledge, <italic>c</italic>, or in communication technology, <italic>h</italic>. These alternative sources of shocks could make our interpretations problematic. However, since most changes in information and communication technology are economywide changes, the fact that our results are about changes and hold after detrending at the firm or layer level alleviates, to a large extent, this concern.</p>

In this case the distribution shifts down, as expected from the theory and the layer-level outcomes, for all percentiles in firms with three and four layers and for most percentiles in firms with one and two layers. In the case of one- and two-layer firms, wages at the very top of the distribution increase. This might be the result of some rent extraction by top managers and owners before firms exit.</p>

            <p>We have relied on a dynamic interpretation of a theory that is static in nature. In so doing, we have implicitly assumed that firms can quickly react to revenue-enhancing shocks with organizational changes. Fully fledged dynamic extensions of the theory that incorporate organizational adjustment costs may shed further light on the changes in the organization of forward-looking firms and its implications.</p>

            <p>Calvo and Wellisz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf12">1978</xref>) and Qian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf21">1994</xref>) present theories in which efficiency wages decrease as the span of control is reduced. However, these theories are silent about the way in which growing firms reorganize and, as a result, change the number of employees and wages at each layer.</p>
