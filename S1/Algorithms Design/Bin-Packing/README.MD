Bin Packing Project ( 1 Dimensional )

Common Techniques used in the project:

•	First Fit, First Fit Decrease, 
•	Worst Fit, Worst Fit Decrease, 
•	Next Fit, Next Fit Decrees,
•	Best Fit Best Fit Decrease.

Cutting Techniques used in the project:

1.	Cutting in half
2.	Cutting using Average of list
3.	Cutting using Standard Deviation of List
4.	Cutting using Max Spaces (Empty Space Tolerance)

Interlacing Techniques used in the project:

1.	Normal Interlacing
2.	Reverse-Second Interlacing
3.	Reverse-First Interlacing
4.	Cut in half Self and Self-Reverse-self Second Interlacing
5.	Cut in half Self and Self-Reverse-self First Interlacing

Mixed Techniques used in the project:

•	Cutting + combined (FF +BF)
•	Cutting + combined (WF +BF)
•	Cutting + combined (NF +BF)

•	Interlacing +Cutting + combined (FF +BF)
•	Interlacing (self) + Cutting + combined (WF +BF).
  This one (Mostly Gives us the most optimal Solution or the Least number of Wasted Spaces)
•	Interlacing + Cutting + combined (NF +BF)
