         <abstract>
            <p>Self-control problems change the logic of agency theory by partly aligning the interests of the firm and worker: both now value contracts that elicit future effort. Findings from a year-long field experiment with full-time data entry workers support this idea. First, workers increase output by voluntarily choosing dominated contracts (which penalize low output but give no additional rewards for high output). Second, effort increases closer to (randomly assigned) paydays. Third, the contract and payday effects are strongly correlated within workers, and this correlation grows with experience. We suggest that workplace features such as high-powered incentives or effort monitoring may provide self-control benefits.</p>

            <p>Ariely and Wertenbroch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf5">2002</xref>) test for procrastination in effort by hiring university students to proofread text over 3 weeks with a maximum total payout of $10. They find that allowing students to self-impose intermediate deadlines raises performance. Burger, Charness, and Lynham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf13">2009</xref>) pay students to study and examine the impact of externally imposed deadlines and the relationship with willpower depletion; the deadlines actually lower performance. However, since students are not given the option to self-impose penalties for procrastination, the results are more difficult to interpret. More generally, there is scant empirical evidence on self-control in realistic workplace settings involving nonstudent populations, high stakes (i.e., full-time earnings), and long durations. Two recent papers document results consistent with time inconsistency among bank workers (Cadena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf14">2011</xref>) and bicycle taxi drivers (Dupas and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">2013</xref>).</p>

            <p>In pioneering work on this point, List (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf49">2006</xref>) shows that while experienced sports card traders exhibit gift exchange in the lab, this effect is strongly attenuated in an actual market environment. In a field experiment on gift exchange, Gneezy and List (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf34">2006</xref>) find that treatment effects on worker effort wear off after a few hours, suggesting that short-run responses can provide misleading estimates. A growing literature uses field experiments to test features of worker effort other than self-control (e.g., Shearer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf63">2004</xref>; Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf9">2007</xref>; Fehr and Goette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf29">2007</xref>; Hossain and List <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf39">2012</xref>).

            <p>Although we find a strong correlation between the payday and contract choice effects, neither effect is well predicted by conventional “lab experiment” measures of time inconsistency, such as subjects’ choices among cash payments at different times. These results line up well with the interesting lab results of Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf7">2014</xref>), who find present bias in effort tasks but fail to find it for cash discounting tasks among student subjects.</p>

            <p>The regularity conditions and the properties of <italic>c</italic>′(·) guarantee single-peakedness of the maximand.

            <p>Another issue is that we take the period between payments as exogenous. Endogenizing the length of time between pay periods is an interesting issue in its own right. Even if more frequent payment mitigates the work self-control problem, it may carry transaction costs and exacerbate the consumption self-control problem, since infrequent payment may be an implicit savings commitment device. Indeed, there were several instances over the course of the project in which workers asked management to withhold their earnings for weeks at a time because this would help them save for lump-sum expenditures.</p>

            <p>The three target levels were set at 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000 accurate fields, respectively. In the first month of randomizations, these corresponded to the 30th, 50th, and 70th percentiles, respectively, of production under the control contract. Initially, the target assignment was only to level 1 and level 2 targets. Assignment to the level 3 target was added later, as production levels increased. During the last month of contract randomizations, we changed these levels to 4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 accurate fields to correspond to increases in worker production over time.</p>

            <p>Such “pay cycle” behavior has been documented in other domains as well. For example, Shapiro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf62">2005</xref>) documents time inconsistency in consumption by showing that the caloric intake of food stamp recipients in the United States declines by 10–15 percent over the food stamp month.</p>

            <p>Under the null hypothesis of time consistency, take-up of dominated contracts should be zero. We view 36 percent as a sizable take-up rate and interpret it as a useful and important summary statistic in support of our model. However, ultimately our test of proposition 2 is whether the contract treatments affect production and earnings.</p>

            <p>Since workers are assigned to each treatment a fixed number of times in each 12-day period, assignment on a given day is correlated with the probability of future treatments in each block. This mechanical correlation could affect the estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tb4">table 4</xref>. In app. table 6, we control for the probabilities of the worker receiving each contract assignment for that observation given the worker’s previous assignments in that randomization block. An <italic>F</italic>-test of joint significance of the probability covariates has a <italic>p</italic>-value of .45, indicating that the assignment probabilities have little predictive power. Their inclusion also has little impact on the estimated treatment effects.</p>

            <p>We can compute this statistic only for workers who were assigned to the control contract on both paydays and nonpaydays during employment. This reduces our sample size for this analysis from 8,423 to 8,240 observations.</p>

            <p>The large production effect of the option to choose a dominated contract on high payday impact workers does not seem to be driven completely by the impact on attendance. For high payday impact workers, the average treatment effects on production and attendance are 395 fields and 4.4 percentage points, respectively. For these workers, mean production conditional on attendance is 5,581 fields. As a simple calibration, 5,581 × 0.044 = 245 &lt; 395. Moreover, regressing production conditional on attendance on the contract treatment dummies yields positive and significant coefficients (app. table 3), although these are difficult to interpret since attendance is endogenous.</p>

            <p>There are no significant differences in the elasticity of output with respect to wages between workers with above- and below-average payday effects (app. table 7, cols. 2 and 3).</p>

            <p>When low payday effect workers miss their targets (whether they are self-chosen or exogenously imposed), this decreases their future probability of taking up the dominated contract by 12 percentage points and also decreases the target levels they select. In contrast, missing targets appears to have no impact on the future take-up behavior of high payday effect workers on average (app. table 8).</p>

            <p>Note that <xref ref-type="table" rid="tb7">table 7</xref> regressions use observations after 1 month of experience to examine trends after workers have learned about the contracts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sc4.4">Sec. IV.D</xref>). Using all observations does not qualitatively change the results but slightly decreases their precision.</p>

            <p>There is also some heterogeneity in effects by gender. The option to choose has larger treatment effects on output and earnings for men than for women. However, there is no difference in the pay cyle effects by gender.</p>

            <p>Free entry of firms implies that under all contracts, firms will make zero expected profits, with expected wages equal to expected production. When firms are competing to hire workers, workers will wind up being compensated for earning less when output realizations are low by being better compensated when output is high.</p>
