         <abstract>
            <p>This paper offers some new estimates of the contribution of learning to the rapid increases in labor productivity observed in the construction of Liberty ships during World War II. The study exploits new data on physical capital investment and vessel quality constructed from contemporary records held at the National Archives. Estimates of the rate of learning are shown to be sensitive to the inclusion of the new capital data, and data on vessel quality provide evidence that part of the measured productivity increases were secured at the expense of quality.</p>

               <p>Financial support was received from a Research Initiation Grant at the University of Houston. I am grateful to Richard Peuser and Becky Livingstone of the National Archives, Washington, for invaluable assistance in locating uncatalogued records; to Anna Hickman for hospitality during data collection; and to Jim Bessen, Margaret Byrne, Boyan Jovanovic, Steven Klepper, Sam Kortum, and Christian Murray for extremely helpful discussions. Peter Pumphrey provided much needed advice on engineering aspects related to fractures. I am also indebted to Lars Hansen and an anonymous referee for suggesting numerous improvements.</p>

            <title>Data Sources</title>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, box numbers refer to boxes in the National Archives, Records of the Office of the Historian, U.S. Maritime Commission, RG178.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>A. Ship identifiers.</italic>—Hull names and USMC identifying numbers were taken from Bunker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf7">1972</xref>, pp. 207–58). Supplementary information, particularly to track numerous name changes during the war, was taken from Sawyer and Mitchell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1985</xref>). Builders' hull numbers are contained in handwritten tabulations located in the National Archives, Records of the Production Division, U.S. Maritime Commission, various boxes, RG178.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>B. Production dates.</italic>—Production times, decomposed into days between keel laying and launching, and days between launching and delivery, were taken from handwritten tabulations by G. J. Fischer, chief statistician, USMC (located in boxes 30 and 31). For each ship, either a date of keel laying or a date of delivery was taken from unattributed typescript tabulations (presumably written under the direction of Fischer, as several copies have annotations in his handwriting), located in boxes 35 and 37. Records indicate that delivery to the USMC was always made the same day the ship was made ready for delivery. Missing dates were therefore obtained by combining production times with the known dates of delivery or keel laying.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>C. Monthly output.</italic>—The rate of output was constructed from the dates of keel laying and delivery. For each ship, a linear rate of production was assumed, so that the allocation of production of a ship to any given month is proportional to the fraction of total production time that fell in that month.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>D. Productivity.</italic>—Direct, indirect, and total labor hours per ship were obtained from unattributed typescript tabulations located in boxes 35 and 37. These data should be uncommonly accurate. The USMC stationed auditors at each yard to calculate direct labor hours expended on each ship on a daily basis. Indirect labor was allocated to ships from weekly payroll data. No information is available on how indirect labor hours were allocated to each ship, although the methodology appears to approximate a weighted combination of production time and labor hours expended on each ship. Every two weeks, the data were compiled and submitted to the Finance Division of the USMC for reimbursement.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>E. Ship quality.</italic>—Dates and severity of fractures are taken from Bates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf3">1946</xref>) and from Board of Investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">1945</xref>). Fracture severity is indicated by class. A class I fracture is one that either results in the actual loss of a vessel or has progressed to such an extent into the strength deck or shell as to endanger the safety of the vessel. A class II fracture is one that does not immediately place the vessel in danger but has the potential to develop into a class I fracture. Descriptions of fracture types are given in Board of Investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">1945</xref>). Dates of war losses (by cause) are taken from Economics and Statistics Division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf10">1946</xref>). War loss data were supplemented by information in Sawyer and Mitchell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1985</xref>).</p>
            <p>
               <italic>F. Employment.</italic>—Monthly employment data are constructed from the number of direct and indirect workers, and average hours worked, contained in Bureau of Labor Statistics forms BLS 1761, Plant Operations, box 36. The data refer to employment on the fifteenth of the month. These data differ slightly from employment data tabulated in Fischer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf12">1949</xref>). Fischer's data combine two sources, some of which report end‐of‐month employment and some of which report midmonth employment. Sunday shift employment data were also taken from BLS 1761.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>G. Capital authorizations.</italic>—The dates, amounts, and purpose of each authorization for shipyard facilities were taken from “Statement of Facilities Contracts, Vouchers Passed for Payment, as of March 31 1946,” box 56; “Facilities Allotments from Minutes Cards,” handwritten tabulations, box 32; and “Major, Minor and Military Types of Vessels Constructed in 1936–1945,” undated typescript, box 42. The source for these data was found damaged in the National Archives, and sheets for several large yards are missing. Detailed capital authorizations by date are available for (number of Liberty ships delivered in parentheses) Bethlehem‐Fairfield (384), Calship (336), Delta (188), North Carolina (126), Oregon (330), and Todd‐Houston (208). These six yards account for a little over 50 percent of all Liberty ship production.</p>
